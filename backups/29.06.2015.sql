Located on the railway line Elec - Eagle.\r\nThe settlement was found at the beginning of XVII century and was called Podvorgolskaya village - by location at upriver of Vorgol.\r\nAccording to documents of 1676 village has 30 sites.\r\nVillage was called in name of owners Izmaylov, according to documents of XVII and XVIII centuries.\r\nIn historical records said that village area was beautiful. 150 acres include large forest, climate is healthy, with corny chernozem ground. River was replaced with artificial ponds and a brook. Mountains and today have rich quarries. Here was produced a special kind of clay for dishes making, and brick sand.\r\nObviously these natural resources attracted first inhabitants, which settle the Podvorgolskomu village. It is difficult to determine when the first settlement was appeared here. In the early XVII century here was Izmalkovo village, in ownership of Izmaylov. Two persons from this family were wanted for military service, it is proved by official documents. Since 1692 Izmaylov village became boundary as Ryabinky, Kazevaya and Koshkino village. Izmalkovo village named so after it's owners, hardly was the undivided area of a only one noble family. To all appearances Podvorgolsky village was named Jurlovo because in that times land has two owners (Izmalkova and Jurlovy families) Local legend claim that in the XVII century, land Urlov lived here, who gave the village it's name. Documents of 1727 referred: "In Eletsky county, nobleman Ivan Urlov was invited to Voronezh council about taxes from peasants. But he cancel invitation. With following words "he is not the man who can decide such things. Eletsk province has a lot of significant and intelligent persons".\r\nFrom these data we can conclude that the first founders of the Podvorgolskogo village were Izmalkova and Yurlovo families and church appeared here in second quarter of XVIII century. But at the end of this century church undoubtedly existed before 1836, when the stone church was built in the village there was a wooden church of the Holy Great Dmitry Solunsky. Obviously, at that time village was called Podvorgolskim because of Vorgol river, the bed of which is formed in the 5 miles from the village.\r\nIn 1866 Podvorgolskoe village has the church, 137 sites, 1 428 inhabitants. According to the 1880 - 228 sites, 1510 residents, school. Later the village was named as Izmalkovo. Population were involved farming, pottery, production of bricks, stone breaking and worked at the station from local merchants.									f	2013-11-20 07:13:21.597679	2014-01-28 11:15:50.305808

Здесь на 150 десятинах рос большой лес, климат — здоровый, при хлебородной черноземной почве. Однако в селе нет реки, которую заменяли искусственные пруды и ключевой ручей. В горах и сегодня имеются богатые каменоломни. Здесь добывался особый род глины, год­ной для выделки разной посуды, и песок для изготовле­ния кирпичей.\r\nОчевидно, эти природные богатства и привлек­ли сюда первых обитателей, положивших основание селу Подворгольскому. За отсутствием точных данных трудно определить, когда возник здесь первый посе­лок. Одно лишь несомненно: в начале XVII века сущес­твовала деревня Измалково, находившаяся во владении помещиков Измалковых, из рода которых в 1721 году, как видно из актов упраздненной Елецкой провинци­альной канцелярии, разыскивались два «не служащих недоросля-ельчанина: Ефим и Афанасий Измалковы» для отбывания воинской повинности. А в выписках из Писцовых и Межевых книг 1692 года, где определя­ются поземельные владения казаков Елецкой Алексан­дровской слободы, «деревня Измалково» поименована как пограничная, наряду с селом Рябинки и деревнями Казевой и Кошкиной. Однако деревня Измалково, на­званная так по имени своих помещиков, едва ли пред­ставляла безраздельное владение одного дворянского рода. Судя по тому, что за селом Подворгольским тог­да ещё удерживалось малоупотребительное название «Юрлово», можно думать, что одновременно с помещи­ками Измалковыми здесь имел свои владения род Юр­ловых. Местное предание действительно утверждает, что в XVII веке здесь проживал помещик — воевода Юр­лов, который и дал деревне свое имя. А в актах Елецкой провинциальной канцелярии за 1727 год упоминается "Елецкого уезду, дворянин Иван Юрлов, который вмес­те с другими представителями Елецкого дворянства был вызван в Воронеж для совета, и подачи мнения об удобнейшем и более легком взимании с крестьян подушной подати. Но он отказался от своей почетной миссии. Под предлогом, «что посланы они из самых ми­зерных, а у такого-де дела надлежит быть по указу из самых знатных, а такие-де знатные и фамильные люди в Елецкой провинции имеются».\r\nИз этих сведений можно сделать вывод, что пер­выми основателями села Подворгольского были по­мещики Измалковы и Юрловы и что церковного при­хода здесь не было до начала второй четверти XVIII века. Но уже в конце этого века приход, несомненно, существовал, так как до 1836 года, когда был пост­роен каменный храм, в селе имелся деревянный храм во имя святого великомученика Дмитрия Солунского, успевшего к тому времени обветшать. Очевидно, в то время село стало называться Подворгольским потому, что из находящегося здесь колодца и ключей берет начало речка Воргол, русло которой образуется в 5 верстах от села.\r\nВ списке населенных мест 1866 года — село казенное и владельческое Подворгольское с церковью, 137 дво­ров, 1428 жителей. По данным 1880 года, в нем было 228 дворов, 1510 жителей, школа. Позднее за селом за­крепилось наименование Измалково. Население кроме земледелия занималось выделкой глиняной посуды, кир­пичей, ломкой камня и работало на станции у местных торговцев.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2013-11-20 07:13:22.392978	2013-11-20 07:13:22.392978

Необходимо было перенести из центра села кладбище. Генпланом развития райцентра тогда занимался архитектор В. М. Попов. Он разместил в Плоском 2-этажные дома, райисполком, гостиница, военкомат, универмаг, спорткомплекс в парке на берегу созданного каскада прудов. Их, кстати до сих пор зовут «рублёвскими», по имени тогдашнего руководителя района. Центральная улица должна была превратиться в бульвар, однако этого не произошло: сегодня в её центре — цветочные клумбы.\r\n\r\nБульвар на Центральной улице\r\nВ июне 1984 года в состав села Плоского вошли деревня Становая и пристанционный поселок Становая. В октябре 1984 году населенный пункт переименован в село Становое.\r\nВ 1995 году в селе был открыт Клуб музейного типа, который стал культурным центром района.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2013-11-20 07:05:18.093413	2013-11-21 17:11:52.833105

Izmalkovo village named so after it's owners, hardly was the undivided area of a only one noble family. To all appearances Podvorgolsky village was named Jurlovo because in that times land has two owners (Izmalkova and Jurlovy families) Local legend claim that in the XVII century, land Urlov lived here, who gave the village it's name. Documents of 1727 referred: "In Eletsky county, nobleman Ivan Urlov was invited to Voronezh council about taxes from peasants. But he cancel invitation.

Eletsk province has a lot of significant and intelligent persons".\r\nFrom these data we can conclude that the first founders of the Podvorgolskogo village were Izmalkova and Yurlovo families and church appeared here in second quarter of XVIII century. But at the end of this century church undoubtedly existed before 1836, when the stone church was built in the village there was a wooden church of the Holy Great Dmitry Solunsky. Obviously, at that time village was called Podvorgolskim because of Vorgol river, the bed of which is formed in the 5 miles from the village.\r\nIn 1866 Podvorgolskoe village has the church, 137 sites, 1 428 inhabitants.

1055	550	ru	Тепличный комплекс «ЛипецкАгро»	Торжественное открытие первой очереди инновационного автоматизированного тепличного комбината «ЛипецкАгро» состоялось в Данковском районе Липецкой области. На площади 4,3 га будет выращиваться более двух тысяч тонн овощной продукции в год.\r\nУникальный, единственный в стране – такие характеристики давали проекту гости, в числе которых был глава Липецкой области Олег Королёв, инвесторы, руководители районов, предприятий, ведущие специалисты в области овощеводства. \r\n«Сегодня мы открываем первый в России проект с теплицами пятого поколения, где высокая урожайность достигается при минимальных энергозатратах», - сообщил председатель совета директоров ООО «ТК «ЛипецкАгро» Дмитрий Лашин. \r\nПервая очередь комплекса была возведена и оснащена в рекордные сроки – за четыре месяца. Здесь установлено современное отечественное технологическое оборудование и системы управления. Создано около 60 рабочих мест, в дальнейшем, при выходе на полную мощность, число вакансий увеличится до пятисот. Предполагается, что это произойдет к 2016 году. \r\nВ вводом второй очереди площадь расширится до 9,4 га с годовым объемом урожая в 6,5 тыс. тонн. В общей сложности инвесторы планируют вложить в комплекс 3,5 млрд рублей, 850 млн из которых уже освоены. \r\nДмитрий Лапшин отметил, что реализация проекта стала возможна при тесном взаимодействии с областными властями, которые обеспечили площадку инженерной инфраструктурой и оказали поддержку компании в виде льготы по налогу на имущество на сумму 53,6 млн рублей, и ОАО «Сбербанк». \r\nВ свою очередь глава Липецкой области Олег Королев поблагодарил инвесторов за то, что они «поверили в Данковский район». \r\n«После развала СССР сельское хозяйство было разрушено. Но сейчас мы видим, что и село, и сельское хозяйство возрождаются. Приходят современные технологии, благодаря которым достигается уникальная производственная мощность. Здесь с одного квадратного метра будут собирать 75 килограммов овощей! Такие проекты обеспечат высокие темпы агропромышленного развития Липецкой области, достойную работу и высокий уровень качества жизни населения. Вместе с тем появление таких проектов говорит о благоприятном инвестиционном климате, созданном в регионе», - подчеркнул Олег Королёв.\r\nПо окончании торжественной церемонии глава региона вместе с руководством компании и гостями осмотрел теплицы. 25 декабря прошлого года специалисты посеяли рассаду салата на площади в 0,4 га, урожай будет собран уже через месяц. В апреле появятся первые томаты. \r\n«Тепличный комплекс мирового уровня. Это огромный технологический прорыв в овощеводстве закрытого грунта», - такую оценку увиденному дал президент ассоциации «Теплицы России» Аркадий Муравьев, принимавший участие в открытии. \r\n	Данковский район, Липецкой области				Сдана первая очередь						Данковский район, Липецкой области	2014-10-08 09:44:57.098271	2015-01-30 09:17:37.762268

Проект реализуется на территории особой экономической зоны регионального уровня промышленно-производственного типа «Тербуны». \r\nПредприятие приступило к выпуску продукции 26 июня 2013 года. Номенклатура выпускаемой продукции будет состоять из двух фармацевтических групп медицинских препаратов: антибиотики (28 лекарственных препаратов) и цитостатики (11 лекарственных препаратов). Все препараты, планируемые к производству, относятся к дженерикам. Общее количество лекарственных средств составит 58 наименований. Ежегодные объемы реализации продукции завода после выхода на проектную мощность будут составлять более 100 млн. упаковок лекарственных препаратов. \r\nОсновная производственная площадка компании ЗАО «Рафарма» - многопрофильный фармацевтический комплекс, расположенный на территории Особой экономической зоны промышленно-производственного типа «Тербуны» Липецкой области. \r\nПроект инициирован Фондом поддержки здравоохранения «ЗДОРОВЬЕ» и является одним из самых масштабных проектов последних лет в медицинской промышленности РФ. \r\nПроект реализуется при поддержке Администрации Липецкой области, Минпромторга России и Минздравсоцразвития России и соответствует основной задаче «Стратегии развития фармацевтической промышленности Российской Федерации на период до 2020 года», а именно – созданию современной высокоэффективной производственной базы, соответствующей стандартам GMP и обеспечивающей импортозамещение и конкурентоспособность как на внутреннем, так и на внешнем рынках. \r\nПосле завершения строительства ЗАО «Рафарма» станет одним из крупнейших российских фармацевтических предприятий общей площадью 25 000 м2, состоящим из отдельно расположенных автономных корпусов полного цикла по производству лекарственных препаратов различных групп, а также автономного упаковочно-складского корпуса. В управлении качеством планируется соответствие стандартам ISO с последующей международной сертификацией Британского института Стандартов BSI. Такая организация производства полностью соответствует международным стандартам и позволит обеспечить мировой уровень отечественного производства лекарственных средств, а также создаст предпосылки для привлечения крупнейших зарубежных и отечественных фармацевтических компаний для размещения контрактного производства.\r\nФармацевтический комбинат ЗАО «Рафарма» создается как быстротрансформируемое зонированное предприятие с изначально заложенной возможностью строительства новых производственных мощностей. Это придает предприятию максимальную универсальность и потенциал для дальнейшего развития.\r\nРеализация проекта «Рафарма» в Российской Федерации будет способствовать удовлетворению потребности населения в доступных, высокоэффективных, качественных и безопасных препаратах, что приведет к улучшению здоровья и увеличению продолжительности жизни населения, а также повышению лекарственной безопасности страны путем импортозамещения стратегически важных препаратов.\r\nВ сентябре 2012 года ЗАО «Рафарма» получено разрешение на ввод объекта в эксплуатацию № RU 48515314-007. В ноябре 2012 г. получена лицензия № 12000-ЛС-П от 09.11.2012, в которую включен необходимый перечень работ, составляющих деятельность по производству лекарственных средств, в соответствии с основным назначением предприятия: производство, хранение и реализация стерильных и нестерильных лекарственных препаратов, в том числе препаратов, содержащих антибиотики и цитостатики; производство, хранение и реализация стерильных и нестерильных лекарственных препаратов, не требующих специального выделения в отдельное производство; упаковочное производство.»\r\nПредприятие располагает возможностями для организации контрактного производства по первичной и вторичной упаковке лекарственных средств.\r\n	f	3	2013-10-23 16:41:53.725322	2015-02-05 09:00:37.715048	Lipestk Oblast, Terbunsky district	4230	5
